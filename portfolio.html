                            <p>This poster portrays a key moment from the fairytale “The Seven Ravens” by the Brothers Grimm through metaphoric imagery. I went for a stained glass window design, comparing that art medium with the glass mountain in the story.</p>

                            <h3>First Pressing</h3>
                            <p>First Pressing is an imaginary vinyl record store I came up with for the identity branding assignment in visual communications. The store itself caters more towards music nerds that understand the technical parts of music. Because of this, i chose a natural symbol paired and elegant serif typeface for my logo.</p>

                            <p>For this video, I used audio from the show "Schitt's Creek" to experiment with Kinetic Type. I used several different means of text animation to amplify the natural comedy from the scene and, in some cases, highlight the tension growing between the two characters as they argue.</p>

                            <p>Midnight Melt is a hypothetical food truck that I had to create a Logo and Website wireframes for in Interactie Design. My logo is a moon rising over water to represent the fact that it is a late-night food truck and it's various locations in Norfolk, Va.</p>

                            <p>This illustrated city poster is meant to clearly depict a city using one or multiple landmarks  havily associated with it. I chose Athens, Greece for my city and used the Acropolis from the Parthenon because it is the main tourist attraction in Athens.</p>

                            <p>This video is set to and instrumental cover of the song "Confident" by Demi Lovato. My goal with this project was to mimic the music with the movement of the shapes. For instance, the rows of circles at the beginning are reminiscent of a bow moving across violin strings.</p>

                            <p>These are a collection of pictograms I created based off of one of the many logos created for the LA 2028 Olympics. The logo I chose was submitted by Alice Stroker, and it combines the image of a musical note and a wheelchair to create an 'A.'</p>

                            <p>This is a title sequence I came up with for the movie “The Hunger Games: Catching Fire.” For the assignment, we werent allowed to use movie footage, so I made silhouettes for the cast and placed videos that symbolized their storyline or personality behind the silhouette mask.</p>

                            <p>This is an introduction pamphlet for a wayfinding system I devised with four other students from my Integrated Design class. The goal was to create symbols that would lead fellow design students from the parking garage to the design building but weren't obvious to outsiders. We stumbled into a jungle theme and ran far with it.</p>

                            <p>An animated version of the logo I created for my festival project in Integrated Design. The overall style of this festival, which I created, had a punk/grunge feel. I chose the write-on effect because it amplified the messy, textured feel I wanted all designs for this fesitval to have. </p>
